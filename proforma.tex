\section*{Original Aims}
{
    The aim of the project was to build an optimising compiler from a subset of Haskell to Java Bytecode, exploring compiler and language implementation beyond what was covered in the Tripos. Extensions included supporting typeclasses and class instances, monads, a larger subset of Haskell, and additional optimisations such as strictness analysis.
}
\section*{Work Completed}
{
    All stages in a traditional optimising compiler pipeline (except parsing) were implemented, covering a significant subset of Haskell, supporting non-strict evaluation, and applying a few targeted optimisations. This satisfies all of the success criteria for the project. Further, a number of the suggested extensions were implemented that significantly increase the expressivity of the original subset of Haskell: typeclasses, monads, and datatypes. Finally, the effectiveness of optimisations were evaluated and the project was compared to similar compilers on a variety of performance metrics.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

    None.
